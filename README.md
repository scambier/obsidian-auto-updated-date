# Obsidian Automatic 'updated' Header

This Obsidian plugin automatically adds a front matter `updated` field to your notes. This field is automatically updated to the current date and time whenever you save a note.

## Motivation

When writing, reviewing, and sharing notes, it is often useful to have a timestamp of when the note was last updated. The OS "last modified" file system timestamp is not very reliable when you use a syncing solutions, or have moved the files around.


## Features

- [x] Datetime format customization
- [x] Field name customization
- [x] Option to create the front matter if it doesn't exist
- [x] Option to add the field if it doesn't exist

## TODO

- [ ] Working on mobile - why doesn't it work?
- [ ] Command to quickly toggle the plugin
  - [ ] Add a "blacklist" or "whitelist" option to exclude certain files?
- [ ] Moment locale override?
