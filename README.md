# Obsidian Automatic 'updated' Header

This Obsidian plugin automatically adds an updated a front matter `updated` value to your notes.

This is very much an alpha version.

## TODO

- [ ] Date format customization
- [ ] Field name customization
- [ ] Option to create the front matter if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Option to add the field if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Moment locale override?
